# CleanRoom Attribution Modeling Toolkit

A privacy-conscious open-source toolkit to simulate Clean Room environments and run various marketing attribution models (rule-based, probabilistic, ML-based, and hybrid) using anonymized or aggregate data. This project aims to help marketing teams and data scientists build and evaluate attribution strategies without violating user privacy.

## 🌐 Why This Project?
As third-party cookies fade and GDPR/CCPA regulations tighten, marketing teams face challenges in linking touchpoints to conversions. Clean Rooms like Google ADH, Meta AA, and Amazon MC offer a privacy-safe alternative — but often lack open-source modeling frameworks. This project fills that gap.

## 📦 Features
- Simulate a cleanroom-like data environment
- Generate synthetic event- and user-level data
- Run rule-based (last-touch, linear), probabilistic (Markov), and ML-based models
- Create hybrid attribution frameworks
- Visualize results with ready-to-use dashboard templates

## 🔧 Model Types
- **Rule-Based**: Last-touch, First-touch, Linear
- **Probabilistic**: Markov chains, Shapley values
- **ML-Based**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Hybrid**: Weighted ensemble or conditional logic blending models

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulated_cleanroom/synthetic_data_generator.py
python models/rule_based.py
```

## 📊 Dashboard
Comes with exportable Tableau templates to visualize attribution paths, ROAS impact, and conversion funnels.

## 📁 Case Study (Coming Soon)
- E-commerce campaign with anonymized data
- Meta Ads + Email + Search interaction modeling
